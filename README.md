# AI Bachelor Course Projects

This repository contains various projects implemented as part of my Bachelor's course in Artificial Intelligence. These projects cover a range of topics from classical AI problems to modern machine learning techniques.

## Projects

### 1. **n-Queen Problem**
   - **Description**: Solves the classic n-Queen problem using backtracking, where the goal is to place `n` queens on an `n x n` chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other.
   - **Topics Covered**: Backtracking, constraint satisfaction.

### 2. **Adversarial Search: Tic-Tac-Toe Using the Minimax Algorithm**
   - **Description**: Implements the Tic-Tac-Toe game using adversarial search, specifically the Minimax algorithm, to create an AI that plays optimally.
   - **Topics Covered**: Game theory, adversarial search, Minimax algorithm.

### 3. **Human Activity Recognition using 2D CNN**
   - **Description**: Utilizes a 2D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify different human activities from sensor data.
   - **Topics Covered**: Convolutional Neural Networks, deep learning, human activity recognition.

### 4. **Human Activity Recognition using LSTM**
   - **Description**: Implements a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to classify human activities, leveraging the temporal dependencies in sequential data.
   - **Topics Covered**: Recurrent Neural Networks, LSTM, time-series data, human activity recognition.

### 5. **Hyperparameter Tuning in Machine Learning**
   - **Description**: Explores various hyperparameter tuning techniques, including grid search and random search, to optimize machine learning models.
   - **Topics Covered**: Hyperparameter tuning, model optimization, machine learning.

### 6. **m-Coloring Problem using Backtracking**
   - **Description**: Solves the m-Coloring problem using backtracking, where the goal is to color the nodes of a graph with `m` colors such that no two adjacent nodes share the same color.
   - **Topics Covered**: Graph coloring, backtracking, constraint satisfaction.

## Getting Started
